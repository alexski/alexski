- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexski aka Alex Baranowski
- 👀 I mainly work with Python, C# (.NET), Postgresql, and MSSQL to build backends and relational databases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Next.js to get myself more familiar with the frontend and Javascript as a whole.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more projects on GitHub to be more involved in the community.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is by email: alexbaranowski96@gmail.com. Hope to hear from you soon.
