- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexski aka Alex Baranowski
-  I mainly work with Python, C# (.NET), Postgresql, and MSSQL to build backends and relational databases.
-  I’m currently learning React to get myself more familiar with frontend development and Javascript.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on more projects on GitHub to be more involved in the community.
-  Best way to reach me is by email: alexbaranowski96@gmail.com. Hope to hear from you soon.
